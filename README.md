# CNN-with-multiple-feature-learning
The coding is the matlab implementaion for the method in paper"Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Multiple Feature Learning" which has been submitted to "Remote Sensing" and still undergoing review.
For the use of the coding, Please download the "matconvnet"from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/ first, add this folder in your current path. 
The data used in the paper are all downloaded from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
If you want to use the method for your own data and reduce any publications from this, please refer this paper. 
Please contact qishuo.gao@student.unsw.edu.au for any further enquires.

Please run test.m for the implementation for the method, and change the path in train_multi.m if you like.
