The coding is the matlab implementaion for the method in paper "Gao, Q., Lim, S. and Jia, X., 2018. Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Multiple Feature Learning. Remote Sensing, 10(2), pp.299."

For the use of the coding, Please download the "matconvnet"from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/ first, add this folder in your current path. 

The data used in the paper are all downloaded from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes

If you want to use the method for your own data and produce any publications from this, please refer this paper. 
Please contact qishuo.gao@student.unsw.edu.au for any further enquires.

Please run test.m for the implementation for the method, and change the path in train_multi.m if you like.
